File structure

- `data/`
  - `sample_submission_v2.csv`
  - `test-jpg/`
  - `test-jpg-additional/`
  - `test_v2_file_mapping.csv`
  - `train-jpg/`
  - `train_v2.csv`
- `xxx.ipynb`
- `xxx.py`

Let's keep data in `data/` folder, which will be not on github, but keep in our local PCs.

And for notebooks & python files, we just put it here!
